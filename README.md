# Morse Code Interpreter

## Application functionality

The `main()` function is the single thread in the application. It toggles the state of a digital output connected to an LED on the board.

**Note**: This example requires a target with RTOS support, i.e. one with `rtos` declared in `supported_application_profiles` in `targets/targets.json` in [mbed-os](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os). 

## Expected output
The LED on your target turns on and off to represent the sent word.
